# QPSK_DNN_Data_Detector

Abstract

In this project, the Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) digital modulation scheme was implemented using Software Defined Radios (SDRs). For this system, a deep learning based detector was proposed and implemented alongside the conventional method. The implementation was successfully achieved for both the conventional and deep learning based data detection techniques, despite the challenges faced. The results show that the proposed deep learning method is able to outperform the conventional detector.
